# Python import modules

### Importing Modules

To make use of the functions in a module, youâ€™ll need to import the module with an import statement.

An import statement is made up of the import keyword along with the name of the module.

In a Python file, this will be declared at the top of the code, under any shebang lines or general comments.

```
import random
```

```
import random
import math


for i in range(5):
    print(random.randint(1, 25))

print(math.pi)
```
